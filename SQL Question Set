Question 1 Find the names of experiments performed by Prof. Pain after Jan 1, 2004.

SELECT name
FROM experiments
WHERE whoperformed= 'Prof.Pain' and date > '2014-01-01' ;

Question 2 Find the names of genes that were either positively expressed twofold or more with a significance of at least 1.0, 
in some experiment, or negatively expressed twofold or less with a significance of at least 1.0, in some experiment. 
List them alongside their organisms in a two-column format.

SELECT Genes.gid, organism, level, significance
FROM Genes, Expression
WHERE Genes.gid=Expression.gid
and significance >= 1.0
and (level>=2 or level<=2);

Question 3 What is the grandparent category of 'glycine binding'?

SELECT parent_category
FROM GOTree
WHERE category= (SELECT parent_category where category = 'glycine binding');

Question 4 Find the names of experiments that were performed before some Gasch experiment.

SELECT name
FROM experiments
WHERE date < (SELECT Max(date) FROM experiment WHERE whoperformed = 'Gasch');

Question 5 Find the names of pine genes that were positively expressed more than 0.5-fold (with a significance of 1.0 or more) 
in at least two experiments.

SELECT DISTINCT g.name
FROM Genes g JOIN Experiments e
ON g.gid = e.gid 
WHERE g.organism = 'pine' and e.signigicance >= 1.0 and e.level > 0.5
Group by g.gid
HAVING COUNT(*) > 2;
